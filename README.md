## Overview

This library contains a plethora of functions peforming mathematical operations on a discrete nature. Taken from the classic text [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth Rosen](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen-dp-125967651X/dp/125967651X/ref=dp_ob_image_bk), this repository contains many programming exercise solutions to challenges found throughout the text.

## Contribution Guide

If you wish to improve or add new exercises, please feel free! Just make sure that you:

-  Add unit tests covering sufficient inputs.
-  Ensure that the variables, parameters, functions, and classes are nmed appropriately as to acheive [self-documenting code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code#:~:text=Self%2Ddocumenting%20code%20is%20ostensibly,symbol's%20meaning%2C%20such%20as%20article.&text=The%20code%20must%20also%20have,easily%20understand%20the%20algorithm%20used.).
-  Open a Pull Request and assign paynemiller92 as the reviewer.
